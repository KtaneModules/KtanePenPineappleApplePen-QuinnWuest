                <h2>On the Subject of Pineapple Pen</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I have a pen, I have a apple,<br>Uh! Apple-pen!</p>
                <p>You are in a random location of a 6×6 grid which you cannot see. You can navigate the grid using the arrows buttons. Also a solve button is present that will solve the module, but do not press it just yet.</p>
                <p>Within the grid is a pen and a pineapple. You must find and pick up the pen, and then bring it to the pineapple, so that you can make a pineapple pen. You will automatically pick up the pen when you navigate to it. There are also a bunch of apples in the grid. <em>Do not touch the apples at all costs</em>.</p>
                <p>To navigate the grid safely, upon hovering over the arrow buttons you will hear "APPLE", "PINEAPPLE", "PEN", or nothing to indicate what is directly adjacent in that direction. <b>Note that the grid does wrap around</b>.</p>
                <p>Once you have successfully made a pineapple-pen, the arrow buttons will no longer function. You may then press the solve button to solve the module.</p>
                <p>If you have the gaul to actually touch an apple or press the solve button before making a pineapple pen, the module will strike and reset for your convenience.</p>
                <h4>Special Pairing</h4>
                <p>In the case that an Apple Pen module is on the same bomb as one of these modules, then they will be paired. Each set of paired modules will have the same ID Number on the bottom left display. You must make sure <strong>both</strong> modules are ready to solve before hitting the solve button on either module.</p>
                <p>If done correctly, then you have made a Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen. Congratulations!</p>
                <p>If one module in the pair solves while the other one strikes, the modules will unlink.</p>
