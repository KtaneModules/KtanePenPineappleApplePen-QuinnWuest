                <h2>On the Subject of Apple Pen</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I have a pen, I have pineapple,<br>Uh! Pineapple-pen!</p>
                <p>You are in a random location of a 6×6 grid consisting of apples, pens, and pineapples. You can freely move around the grid using the four directional arrow buttons. The grid wraps around.</p>
                <p>One position in the grid will cause the small LED at the top right of the module to turn on. This signifies that you have reached the <em>starting cell.</em></p>
                <p>The numbers in the displays at the top left will be referred to as <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>. X and Y will always be a number from 1 to 5, and may be adjusted using the arrows above and below the displays.</p>
                <p>From the starting cell, travelling X cells right, noting down its image, travelling Y cells down, and noting down that image will get you a two-image pair.</p>
                <p>From this new cell, travelling X cells right, noting down its image, travelling Y cells down, and noting down that image will get you another two-image pair. Doing this sequence two more times will get you a total number of four two-image pairs.</p>
                <p>Adjust X and Y so that, the fourth pair creates an <em>apple-pen</em>, while the first three pairs <strong>do not</strong> create an <em>apple-pen</em>. There may be multiple solutions.</p>
                <p>After correctly adjusting X and Y, press the Solve button to submit your answer.</p>
                <h4>Special Pairing</h4>
                <p>In the case that a Pineapple Pen module is on the same bomb as one of these modules, then they will be paired. Each set of paired modules will have the same ID Number on the bottom left display. You must make sure <strong>both</strong> modules are ready to solve before hitting the solve button on either module.</p>
                <p>If done correctly, then you have made a Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen. Congratulations!</p>
                <p>If one module in the pair solves while the other one strikes, the modules will unlink.</p>
